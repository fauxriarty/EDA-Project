# Course Project for EDA - Bank Marketing Dataset

## Student Details:
*   **Name:** Aditya Chheda
*   **Registration Number:** 22BDS0179

## Project Overview:

This project is a part of the BCSE331L (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA) course. The goal is to analyze the provided bank marketing dataset, develop a model, and document the process thoroughly.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset, available at:
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salemprakash/EDA/main/Data/bank.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salemprakash/EDA/main/Data/bank.csv)

This dataset contains information about a bank's marketing campaigns, focusing on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

## Project Instructions and Deliverables:

The project follows a phased approach with specific tasks and submission deadlines:

1.  **Load and Explore the Dataset:**
    *   Load the dataset into a Python environment (using Google Colab).
    *   Explore the dimensions (rows, columns).
    *   Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.
    *   Address Data Handling and Data Cleaning requirements.
    *   Perform Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis, including comprehensive visualizations.

2.  **Submission Phases:**
    *   **Phase I (Due: 15th Aug 2025):** Submit the GitHub repository link. Evaluation will cover tasks up to Multivariate Analysis.
    *   **Phase II (Due: 2nd October [Year not specified, assuming same as Phase I]):** Completion of code up to Module 5 in the GitHub repository.
    *   **Phase III (Due: 10th Nov [Year not specified, assuming same as Phase I]):** Completion of the full project (Modules 2 to 7) in the GitHub repository. Submit the repository link and a comprehensive report on VTop as a single document. Evaluation will include code completion and report completion.

## Repository Structure:

This repository will contain the Google Colab notebook(s) used for the analysis and model development. The notebook(s) will be organized to reflect the project stages and analysis performed.

## How to Run the Notebook:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine or open it directly in Google Colab via GitHub integration.
2.  Ensure you have a Google Colab account.
3.  Run the code cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Dependencies:

*   Python 3
*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   (Other libraries will be added as needed for modeling and further analysis)
